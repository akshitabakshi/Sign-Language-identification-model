# Sign-Language-identification-model

•	Achieved an accuracy of 99.98% on the American Sign Language image classification task using a deep learning model developed in PyTorch 

•	Implemented the ResNet9 architecture in the model and leveraged the power of GPU computing for faster training

•	Utilized weight decay to prevent overfitting and enhance the generalization capability of the model

•	Incorporated gradient clipping to prevent undesirable changes in parameters due to large gradient values

•	Applied the ‘One Cycle Learning Rate Policy’ to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training
